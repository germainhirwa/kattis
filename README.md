# RussellDash332/kattis
This repository is basically a tidier documentation of all my submissions to Kattis.

### Small Notes
+ I will use SpiderMonkey runtime for all JavaScript codes, unless otherwise specified, like in [Autori](https://github.com/RussellDash332/kattis/tree/master/Autori) and [Take Two Stones](https://github.com/RussellDash332/kattis/tree/master/Take%20Two%20Stones).
+ For that, I may create the Node.js version of the code too, some time later.
+ Small tip for Java programs: Use ```BufferedReader``` from ```java.io``` instead of Scanner from ```java.util```. It will improve the performance significantly.

That's all for now. ðŸ˜Š
