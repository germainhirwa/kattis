This repository is basically a tidier documentation of all my submissions to [Kattis](https://nus.kattis.com/).

### Small Notes
+ I will use [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) runtime for all JavaScript codes (since Kattis provides) rather than [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), unless otherwise specified, like in [Autori](https://github.com/RussellDash332/kattis/tree/main/src/Autori) and [Take Two Stones](https://github.com/RussellDash332/kattis/tree/main/src/Take%20Two%20Stones).
> For that, I may create the Node.js version of the code too, some time later.
+ Small tip for Java programs: Use [```BufferedReader```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html) and [```PrintWriter```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html) from [```java.io```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html) to recieve input from STDIN and print to STDOUT instead of [```Scanner```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html) from [```java.util```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html) and merely ```System.out```. Trust me, it will improve the performance significantly, especially in Kattis.

That's all for now. 😊
